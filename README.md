This Java project involves managing an ordered list of objects.  The primary focus of this project is to create a custom class, aOrderedList, which can maintain a sorted list of objects. In this project, the objects are instances of the Car class, representing cars with attributes such as make, year, and price. The program allows for the addition and deletion of cars to and from the list while ensuring that the list remains sorted.
